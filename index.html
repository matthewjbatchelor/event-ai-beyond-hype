                    <h2>AI Beyond the Hype: Making AI Work at Scale</h2>
                    <p>AI pilots are everywhere, but the reality is stark: recent studies show that 95% of enterprise AI pilots never reach production. Despite the hype, many initiatives stall, becoming one-off demos rather than delivering tangible business outcomes. So how do some organisations successfully bridge the "GenAI Divide" and turn AI into a real growth engine?</p>

                    <p>Boardwave invites you to an exclusive dinner in Munich for a practical, experience-driven conversation with Guillaume Esnou, CTO at Invisible Technologies, joined by Benjamin Samuels, General Manager EMEA, Invisible Technologies. Guillaume has worked with leading enterprises to deploy AI at scale, embedding solutions deeply into complex workflows and delivering measurable ROI.</p>

                    <h3>At this dinner, they will share their insights on:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Partnering for success:</strong> Enterprise teams who collaborate with external AI experts succeed at twice the rate of those going it alone.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-value, focused use cases:</strong> The best organisations prioritise narrow but high-value applications, integrating them deeply into workflows and scaling through continuous learning rather than broad feature sets. Domain fluency and workflow integration matter more than flashy UX.</li>
                        <li><strong>ROI in overlooked areas:</strong> Many enterprises discover the greatest returns in back-office operations, finance, and other functions often ignored in AI discussions. The highest-performing organisations report measurable savings from reduced BPO costs and external agency use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Humans in the loop:</strong> AI is not magic and isn't the solution for everything. Success starts with clearly identifying the right problem through deep discovery, defining what success looks like, and choosing the right tools. Human expertise remains foundational, even in highly automated solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lessons from large-scale deployment:</strong> Invisible has trained 80% of the world's leading LLMs and built systems that work in complex enterprise environments. Guillaume will share lessons from deploying AI at scale, including overcoming fragmented systems, legacy infrastructure, and adoption challenges.</li>
